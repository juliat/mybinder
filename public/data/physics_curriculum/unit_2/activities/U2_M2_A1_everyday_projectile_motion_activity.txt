Activity Name: Everyday examples of projectile motion activity

Students have a deep understanding of projectile motion from previous personal experiences, though some of their theories may contain equally deep misconceptions.  The role of friction (especially air resistance) can cause difficulties for students when asked to abstractly consider scenarios without friction.  Everyday examples help to bridge the gap between experiences and abstract constructs.
