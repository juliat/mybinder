Activity Name: An accelerated motion activity which leads to graphing motion data

Students are easily frustrated when rules appear arbitrary or capricious.  Students without a solid conceptual foundation of 1-D motion will see a mathematical treatment of accelerated motion to be unnecessarily complicated and the rules governing problem solving will be baffling and frustrating.  It is important that a student experiences the ways in which accelerated motion yields different relationships between time and position than constant velocity.If an appropriate challenge is selected, not only will a student appreciate the complexity of the situation, but also recognize the need for developing terms to indicate the initial and final velocities, the acceleration of the object and a finer appreciation of what is meant by the time variable.  There are numerous ways to expose students to constant linear acceleration situations; most obviously with objects in freefall, although it is also possible to use objects on inclined planes or computer simulations.  Ideally, students should be able to make quantitative predictions about the motion of an accelerating object and compare that to the observed motion of the object.  Teachers may opt to use the same data-gathering techniques used for the constant velocity tasks assigned in Module 1, or challenge the students to make predictions using a novel data gathering technique.  In either case, students should be able to, without too much guidance by the teacher, recognize the accuracy of their own predictions when compared to the results of their investigations.
