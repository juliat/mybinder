Activity Name: Interpreting motion graphs activity (Walk the Line Activity)

High-school students are expected to learn about graphs in a variety of math contexts; how to plot points in a coordinate plane, how plotted graphs can represent functions, how to find slopes and intercepts, how to shift graphs up or down, how to stretch them, and so on.  In a physics class we also look at graphs, but our primary intent is not to introduce the graphical manipulation and interpretation tools (although many students benefit from the review of the material), but to show how those tools can be used to better understand the world and how it functions.  The “Walk the Line” activity is intended to re-enforce the skill of looking at a graph and visualizing the motion it represents.  Beginning with simple linear, constant velocity motion, students are shown how the image of a plotted line can quickly reveal a lot of information about the motion of an object, even without numerical analysis.  Students are asked to turn a mathematical model into live action, paying particular attention to the shape, the slope, and the intercepts of various x(t) graphs.  Becoming proficient in the skill of rapid qualitative assessment of motion graphs will aid in understanding the difference between instantaneous and average velocity, the difference between positive and negative quantities when analyzing motion, the difference between accelerated and constant velocity motion, and how to interpret the graph of ANY quantity as it varies in time.  As with algebraic manipulations, graph interpretation is one of those physics skills that is both supported by a math background but can also serve to enhance a student’s math experience, as well.
