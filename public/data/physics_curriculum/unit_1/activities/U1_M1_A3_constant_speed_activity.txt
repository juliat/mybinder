Graphs are excellent ways to visualize data. Students need to experience the process of gathering individual data points and then extrapolating patterns based on the visual cues provided by graphing the data. There are numerous ways to gather motion data, including photogates, sonic rangers, ticker-tape timers, stopwatches and meter sticks, simulations, and so on. Depending on your materials, students should be presented with a constant velocity motion which has easily measurable distance and time characteristics. From this, students should be able to generate data tables, then graphs of position vs. time (or displacement vs. time).

Some of the patterns that must be easily discernable are that an object with a constant speed will have a linear x(t) graph and that the slope of the x(t) graph corresponds to the speed of the object. There are, obviously, many other important lessons that can be brought out in the execution of the activity, including fitting theoretical models to experimental data, the reliability of data and a review of graphing techniques.  The focus here is on accurate data collection, with graphing being the transition into Module 2 which actually contains the graphing CE’s and PE’s for Unit 1.
