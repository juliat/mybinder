Misconceptions:
* At times students are reluctant to round off appropriately.
* Displacement is different than distance.  Displacement is the length of a straight line between the start and end point of a path.
* Many students have trouble understanding that if a person is stationary with respect to the Earth that the person may be moving relative to some other observer.

Summary of Unit 1 activities:

Module 1

      Math skills
Need to assess students’ math skills, which are often lower that would be expected given the courses on students' transcripts. Basic algebra is the key in this course, with the use (but not manipulation) of certain trigonometric identities.

      Measuring walking speed (Berated Activity)
As the first lab experiences in the physics classroom, this activity is used to establish behavioral and academic expectations as well as set the tone for the types of investigations during the year. The physics content is an important foundation for all that comes later.

Students should emerge at the end of the activity recognizing that motion can be numerically quantified and that easily measured numbers (time, distance) can be used to generate more descriptive numbers (speed) which can be used to make predictions. Because the ubiquity of rates in introductory physics, this activity can also draw out some of the salient features of rates, providing a useful touchstone for the class when confronted with new rates (acceleration, power, and so on).


      A constant speed activity which leads to graphing motion data
Graphs are excellent ways to visualize data. Students need to experience the process of gathering individual data points and then extrapolating patterns based on the visual cues provided by graphing the data. There are numerous ways to gather motion data, including photogates, sonic rangers, ticker-tape timers, stopwatches and meter sticks, simulations, and so on. Depending on your materials, students should be presented with a constant velocity motion which has easily measurable distance and time characteristics. From this, students should be able to generate data tables, then graphs of position vs. time (or displacement vs. time).

Some of the patterns that must be easily discernable are that an object with a constant speed will have a linear x(t) graph and that the slope of the x(t) graph corresponds to the speed of the object. There are, obviously, many other important lessons that can be brought out in the execution of the activity, including fitting theoretical models to experimental data, the reliability of data and a review of graphing techniques.  The focus here is on accurate data collection, with graphing being the transition into Module 2 which actually contains the graphing CE’s and PE’s for Unit 1.

Module 2

Interpreting motion graphs activity (Walk the Line Activity)
High-school students are expected to learn about graphs in a variety of math contexts; how to plot points in a coordinate plane, how plotted graphs can represent functions, how to find slopes and intercepts, how to shift graphs up or down, how to stretch them, and so on.  In a physics class we also look at graphs, but our primary intent is not to introduce the graphical manipulation and interpretation tools (although many students benefit from the review of the material), but to show how those tools can be used to better understand the world and how it functions.  The “Walk the Line” activity is intended to re-enforce the skill of looking at a graph and visualizing the motion it represents.  Beginning with simple linear, constant velocity motion, students are shown how the image of a plotted line can quickly reveal a lot of information about the motion of an object, even without numerical analysis.  Students are asked to turn a mathematical model into live action, paying particular attention to the shape, the slope, and the intercepts of various x(t) graphs.  Becoming proficient in the skill of rapid qualitative assessment of motion graphs will aid in understanding the difference between instantaneous and average velocity, the difference between positive and negative quantities when analyzing motion, the difference between accelerated and constant velocity motion, and how to interpret the graph of ANY quantity as it varies in time.  As with algebraic manipulations, graph interpretation is one of those physics skills that is both supported by a math background but can also serve to enhance a student’s math experience, as well.   
 
An accelerated motion activity which leads to graphing motion data
Students are easily frustrated when rules appear arbitrary or capricious.  Students without a solid conceptual foundation of 1-D motion will see a mathematical treatment of accelerated motion to be unnecessarily complicated and the rules governing problem solving will be baffling and frustrating.  It is important that a student experiences the ways in which accelerated motion yields different relationships between time and position than constant velocity.  If an appropriate challenge is selected, not only will a student appreciate the complexity of the situation, but also recognize the need for developing terms to indicate the initial and final velocities, the acceleration of the object and a finer appreciation of what is meant by the time variable.  There are numerous ways to expose students to constant linear acceleration situations; most obviously with objects in freefall, although it is also possible to use objects on inclined planes or computer simulations.  Ideally, students should be able to make quantitative predictions about the motion of an accelerating object and compare that to the observed motion of the object.  Teachers may opt to use the same data-gathering techniques used for the constant velocity tasks assigned in Module 1, or challenge the students to make predictions using a novel data gathering technique.  In either case, students should be able to, without too much guidance by the teacher, recognize the accuracy of their own predictions when compared to the results of their investigations.
