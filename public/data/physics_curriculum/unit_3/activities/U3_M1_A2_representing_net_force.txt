Activity Name: Representing net force activity

The concept of net force, the sum of all of the real physical forces acting on an object, is investigated in this activity.  Calculating the net force by adding a variety of forces acting on an object is a part of this activity.  Also a force table may be very instructive in this activity.  The net force is used to explain why an object is moving at a constant velocity (including at rest) or moving with an accelerated velocity.  Previous motion activities can be explained.  The state of motion can be determined and experimentally confirmed.  Problem solving, data collection and confirming calculations through experimentation should be emphasized. The following equipment could be utilized in this activity: carts, ticker tapes, ramps, photo gates, accelerometers, and so on.
