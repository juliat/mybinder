Activity Name: Types of forces activity

<p>
There are many forces that can act on an object.  The students should be exposed to as many forces as possible.  Use a hands-on activity that gives experience dealing with several of the following forces; weight, normal force, frictional force, tension force, compression thrust force, air drag, water drag, and so on.

Problem solving, data collection and confirming theoretical calculations through experimentation should be emphasized.  The following equipment could be utilized in developing this activity: carts, ticker tapes, photo gates, accelerometers, and so on.
