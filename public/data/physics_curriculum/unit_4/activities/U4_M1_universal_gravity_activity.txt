Activity Name: Demonstration and web-based research activity

Though students might be familiar with the role of gravity in everyday interactions such as objects falling toward the Earth, they may not realize the role of gravity in defining the large scale structure of the universe.  They may also not realize the extent to which our knowledge of gravity and massive objects is still being <strong>actively explored</strong> by researchers.
