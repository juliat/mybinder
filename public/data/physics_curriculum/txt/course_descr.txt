The goal of secondary science education in Pennsylvania is to produce scientifically literate citizens through an inquiry-based approach that builds understanding of fundamental scientific processes and principles of biology, chemistry, physics, Earth science, and ecology. However, scientific literacy is not limited to the understanding of fundamental scientific principles. It also involves proficiency in scientific reasoning and the ability to critically analyze the interplay between science, technology, and society. The high school science curriculum provides opportunities for students to practice and apply this type of thinking, thereby cultivating scientific literacy while strengthening overall critical thinking, problem solving, and communication skills.
